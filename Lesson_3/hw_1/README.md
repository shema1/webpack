# project_calendar
This project is a calendar where you can create your own events.
* By default, the main screen is available in the calendar - a week is divided by days, and days by hours.
* The user can switch between weeks using the left-button icons.
* The 'Today' button switches to the current week.
* The user can add an event to the calendar by clicking on the desired area of the day. After that, in the popup you can select the event settings - title, description (optional), exact date, duration in hours.
* You can also add an event by clicking (+) on the left side of the screen.
* An event can be deleted / edited by clicking on it in the calendar
* Validation rules: two events cannot overlap in time, one event cannot be longer than 6 hours, you cannot edit / delete an event earlier than 15 minutes before the start
